# miRNA_analysis

## Introduction

This doc is a record of my work on profiling miRNAs isolated from serum of sheep infected with *Fasciola hepatica*. It acts both as a reference point for when I return to this analysis, a tutorial for anyone else who is interested in similar work and as a transparency measure for any publications that stem from this research. 

## Sample Deets

RNA was isolated from 9 serum samples, collected from sheep experimentally infected with _Fasciola hepatica_. The samples were collected in 2017 and stored at -80c. See the below image for more sample details. ![Screenshot from 2021-11-04 11-22-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75036690/140305398-9f14615f-30a1-4f19-af23-265c145cdbc1.png)

RNA was isolated using [Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Kit (Slurry Format)](https://norgenbiotek.com/product/plasmaserum-circulating-and-exosomal-rna-purification-kit-slurry-format) before pre-sequencing quality control
